![VA](https://github.com/ashutosh786palhare/Python-Micro-Projects/assets/53346137/e87929f5-9f5e-47b3-a660-030e2dd9598b)

This is a simple GUI-based virtual assistant created using Python that incorporates speech recognition and text-to-speech functionalities.

## Features:

- **Voice Input:** Utilizes the microphone for voice input from the user.
- **Text-to-Speech:** Converts the assistant's responses into spoken words.
- **Basic Interaction:** Provides a simple interaction loop where the assistant listens to the user's voice input and responds accordingly.

## Requirements:

- Python 3.x
- `tkinter` (for GUI)
- `pyttsx3` (for text-to-speech)
- `speech_recognition` (for voice input)

## Usage:

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   Ensure you have the required Python libraries installed:
   ```bash
   pip install tkinter pyttsx3 SpeechRecognition
``


2. **Run the Virtual Assistant:**
Execute the Python script to start the virtual assistant:

``
python main.py
``

3. **Interacting with the Assistant:***

- Click the "Speak" button to activate the microphone and speak your query.
- The assistant will attempt to recognize your query, process it, and respond verbally.

## Notes:
- For optimal voice recognition, ensure your microphone is properly set up and functional.
- This is a basic example and can be expanded with additional features and more sophisticated natural language processing (NLP) capabilities.

## Acknowledgements:
This project uses the tkinter, pyttsx3, and speech_recognition libraries.
